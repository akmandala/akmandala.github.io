I think you're very handsome and cannot for the life of me tell if you're gay. You dress really well from what I've seen when you're coming or going. Regardless of your sexual orientation, it might be nice to have a friendly face at the gym. I guess I'm supposed to ask you what you were wearing at the gym today so I know it's really you?",

The breeze picked up and was blowing the elm seeds and flower petals everywhere. As I was trying to get them out of my hair and scarf, I apologized for blowing more of them your way. You didn't mind. And I said I thought it all seemed magical until allergies attack. You laughed. Then you took out a notebook, jotted down something, wished me a good day and left. I really regret not talking to you more, but I can be shy at first- and I think that may be the case for you too. You seemed interesting to me, and you had really nice eyes :) If you see this, maybe we can meet in the park again, listen to the violin, and maybe talk a little more than we did yesterday.",

He brought out a piece of me, I never thought existed. After that night, I felt something was different. *** It was almost 2AM when I got into The Mean Fiddler. That was my last day in New York. I'm a humanitarian worker and human rights activist. Just like others, I'd rather watch late night news, than go clubbing. But that day was different. I wanted to experience New York's nightlife. I gave it to myself because tomorrow, I would be in India and things would be different. So I thought, that was my final chance. I didn't want to miss it. I was on the dance floor, when I met him. His friend introduced me to him. He said they were celebrating his retirement. He approached me. He was wearing a big smile and his eyes were gleaming. He was so inviting. How could I resist. We danced. I couldn't stop staring at him, while he moved his body towards me. I was so mesmerized. I never believe in love at first sight, but that was different. I felt something very special about him. It was so intense and it was making me tremble. So, I just asked his name. He said, \"I'm Kevin.\" I asked what he does. \"I'm a cop.\" My fantasy was doomed. Everybody has prejudices, and I am not an exception. I experienced being beaten by cops in my country. I remember an instance after a human rights protest. I was looking for my flip-flops that I lost during the dispersal, and a cop grabbed me and hit me. It was a painful experience. After that moment, every time I see a cop, I feel fear and hatred. Now, I'm dancing with him. It was really uncomfortable. I was so attracted to him, but it felt not right. He is a cop. I'm an activist. Why are we dancing?! I wanted to walk away, call it a day and just go back to my hotel room. But in a very soft voice, he asked, \"Are you okay?\" I could feel his concern. I was so confused. I couldn't reconcile my prejudices and the man in front of me. I wanted to leave, but there was something that pulls me to him. I couldn't leave him. The feeling was so intense and extraordinary. I didn't want to miss it. So, we continued dancing. I danced like it's the last dance of my life. We were like flowing water dancing with fire. It was so soothing, but fiery. Then he kissed me. It was so daring. I never had been kissed that way before. It was so wonderful and ecstatic. He kissed away all the fears and hatred, I had felt. It was so bold. I couldn't resist not wanting more. But, The Mean Fiddler was about to close. I thought I don't this to be over yet. I don't want to miss the chance of being with him. So, I asked him if he wants to come with me. He did. We went to my hotel room, and continued dancing. But this time, we danced our desires. I was drunk, but I can remember every detail of our one night romance. It was so different. I was never touched, the way he touched me. I was never caressed, the way he did. I felt a special connection with him. I felt more than lust. Then, we reached the peak of our impulses. I let it go and surrendered. Everything was overflowing. It was so cold and soothing. Then, I woke up. I was lying beside him. I felt the tranquility I was yearning to feel. I felt so secure and calm. I never felt what way before. I always woke up anxious and vulnerable. But this time, it was bliss. I was really touched by his presence. I kept on staring at him while he sleeps -- his cute pointed nose and thin lips, his broad shoulders, his tattoo all over his arms.. . Everything is perfect about him. But unfortunately, everything is not perfect about us. I'm a humanitarian worker and activist from the global south. New York is only for short engagement, because the United Nations is there. But it's not the space I wanted to be. While, he belongs to New York and he is making the city a safe place to live in. I was afraid our romance is not feasible. I was afraid if I will push it through, one of us had to leave the people whom we are serving. We both belong to where the people need us most. So, I stood up and started packing my things. My flight was in the next couple of hours. Then, he woke up. It was already 8:45AM. He had an appointment and needed to leave. He gets dressed and about to go. I hugged him so tight. I know this might be the last time that I could hug him. I never wanted to let go. But I needed to. Then, he asked if I want to go out and dance with him again. I said, \"I'm leaving.\" He left. That was the end of it. I continued packing my things, and then went to the airport. I was so sober and confused. I like him so much, but I was so afraid. I wanted to hold his hands, but I was trembling. Then, when I was about to board the plane going to Abu Dhabi, I felt something was wrong. I felt, I did the wrong thing. But it was too late. I missed the opportunity to keep someone who is so precious. Then, I arrived at my destination. It was midnight in Mumbai. The first thing I did upon getting into my hotel room was to search for his name online. But I couldn't remember his last name. It might be, Bradley, Bodley, Codley, Moloney, Langley, or whatever. All I remember was it ended with \"-y\" or maybe not. I was so hopeless. I felt it's over, and there's nothing that I could do anymore. So, days passed. I was in the middle of a meeting, when something popped into my mind. \"Oh! Kevin is with the NYPD!\" Four letters can save me. So, I searched on the NYPD's website, Twitter and Facebook page. He might have a picture or full name there. I was so hopeful. But then, there were none. I couldn't find him. I was so frustrated. I was losing hope. I know I needed to stop my fondness for him. I thought, maybe when I go back to my country, things will be different. I might be missing home. So I did. But then, I failed. Right after I arrived, I was lying down on my bed and about to close my eyes, when I felt something was missing. It's him again. There's no point in denying. I left a part of my heart in New York. So, everyday, I take a look at the NYPD's page, hoping to see him -- the photos of the Saint Patrick's Day parade, the posts about the retirees, the activities, the troopers.. .  I know there are thousands of police officers in New York and the probability of seeing him is almost negative. But, I want to try. I'm still hoping that one day, I will be able to see him. If not, I just want him to know, in the midst of all uncertainties, one thing I'm confident is certain: He stayed with me. The Mean Fiddler. The dance. The kiss. The romance. They will be in my heart, wherever I go. His memories will be with me; in the different countries I set foot on, and in the different continents I cross. Because he wasn't just a cop. He wasn't just a man in uniform. He's the man who brought out a piece of me, I never thought existed. He is the man whom I like so much. And I want him to know, that someone is thinking of him. Someone is hoping that he is safe, while protecting the people of New York. I badly want him to be safe. And, though we live on the opposite sides of the world, but we share the same passion and love for the people. Though his night is my day, but we're under the same sun and breathing the same air. And someday, we might meet again, or maybe not anymore. But, I'm just here waiting on the dance floor, for him to dance with me. ###",
       "bodyCleaned": "It's been more than a month since I met a cop. We've been together for just a night. But I'm still thinking of him. I tried not to, but I couldn't resist his memory in me. He brought out a piece of me, I never thought existed. After that night, I felt something was different. *** It was almost 2AM when I got into The Mean Fiddler. That was my last day in New York. I'm a humanitarian worker and human rights activist. Just like others, I'd rather watch late night news, than go clubbing. But that day was different. I wanted to experience New York's nightlife. I gave it to myself because tomorrow, I would be in India and things would be different. So I thought, that was my final chance. I didn't want to miss it. I was on the dance floor, when I met him. His friend introduced me to him. He said they were celebrating his retirement. He approached me. He was wearing a big smile and his eyes were gleaming. He was so inviting. How could I resist. We danced. I couldn't stop staring at him, while he moved his body towards me. I was so mesmerized. I never believe in love at first sight, but that was different. I felt something very special about him. It was so intense and it was making me tremble. So, I just asked his name. He said, \"I'm Kevin.\" I asked what he does. \"I'm a cop.\" My fantasy was doomed. Everybody has prejudices, and I am not an exception. I experienced being beaten by cops in my country. I remember an instance after a human rights protest. I was looking for my flip-flops that I lost during the dispersal, and a cop grabbed me and hit me. It was a painful experience. After that moment, every time I see a cop, I feel fear and hatred. Now, I'm dancing with him. It was really uncomfortable. I was so attracted to him, but it felt not right. He is a cop. I'm an activist. Why are we dancing?! I wanted to walk away, call it a day and just go back to my hotel room. But in a very soft voice, he asked, \"Are you okay?\" I could feel his concern. I was so confused. I couldn't reconcile my prejudices and the man in front of me. I wanted to leave, but there was something that pulls me to him. I couldn't leave him. The feeling was so intense and extraordinary. I didn't want to miss it. So, we continued dancing. I danced like it's the last dance of my life. We were like flowing water dancing with fire. It was so soothing, but fiery. Then he kissed me. It was so daring. I never had been kissed that way before. It was so wonderful and ecstatic. He kissed away all the fears and hatred, I had felt. It was so bold. I couldn't resist not wanting more.

Even I had said so, I guess my feelings would be of dubious value. I somehow imagine that dopey dingbats like me must fall in love with you every day, and I don't know anything about you, nor you about me. Ah well. Suffice it to say that just seeing your face from halfway across the subway car somehow melted and/or jolted me inside a bit, for whatever it is worth.

Dr. Patrick Carnes Sexual addiction is defined as any sexually-related compulsive behavior which interferes with normal living and causes severe stress on family, friends, loved ones, and one's work environment. Like an alcoholic unable to stop drinking, sexual addicts are unable to stop their self-destructive sexual behavior. This aggression may display itself in a multitude of negative ways, even abuse toward others. Sex addicts come from all walks of life: male and female, all sexual orientations, ages from pre-teens to senior citizens, those employed as laborers or CEOs of major organizations. Sex addiction does not discriminate. Many addicts were abused as children -- sexually, physically, and/or emotionally. Many grew up in families in which addiction already flourished, including alcoholism, drugs, gambling, and/or compulsive eating. Most grapple with other addictions in addition to sex addiction, but often find overcoming sexual addiction the most difficult. Much hope nevertheless exists for these addicts and their families. Sex addicts have shown an ability to transform a life of self-destruction into a life of self-care, a life in chaos and despair into one of confidence and peace. Dr. Patrick Carnes, Out of the Shadows (1983). Can sex be addictive? Yes, it can. First, it is important to understand what addiction is. Understanding the basic fundamentals can help you compare sex addiction to other types of addiction you may be more familiar with, such as drugs or alcohol. Although there are not any substances such as cocaine or beer involved, the brain releases certain chemicals during the performance of sexual behaviors that create the same type of \"high\" feeling as addictive substances. It is these \"high\" feelings that become addictive, and therefore, the behavior that helped create that feeling becomes necessary, not voluntary. Dr. Patrick Carnes in his book, Contrary to Love: Helping the Sexual Addict states, \"Contrary to enjoying sex as a self-affirming source of physical pleasure, the sex addict has learned to rely on sex for comfort from pain, nurturing, or relief from stress, etc., the way an alcoholic relies on alcohol, or a drug addict on drugs.\" It is important to note that just because a person feels good or euphoric after sex or some other sexual behavior that he or she is an addict. If you are concerned you may be addicted to sex or a sexual behavior, please reach out to one of our specially trained therapists for help. Contrary to Love: Helping the Sexual Addict (1989), Dr. Patrick Carnes. How much is too much? The trend in the current psychological literature about \"How much is too much\" has changed over the years. We no longer quantify (or put a number to) how many times a day is too much. Rather, we look at it from a quality of life viewpoint; meaning that a 21-year-old can have sex or masturbate several times a day and still be \"okay.\" The problem, we believe, becomes a problem when the sexual acting out behavior impairs other areas of life. For example, having unprotected sex with many anonymous partners and thereby putting oneself at risk to catch STDs or HIV; masturbating to the point of injury; missing school or work because he or she is busy engaging in or recovering from the sexual activity; continues behavior despite consequences (loss of job, legal problems, broken relationships, etc). Is your behavior a problem? Did you know there are 20 identified behavioral categories of sexual behaviors? Within these categories there are 164 different behaviors that have been identified as problem areas for sex addicts. Just like drug addicts who may have a problem with heroin, but not meth, not all addicts have every behavior and not all behaviors indicate addiction, though if continued, can lead to that in some cases. Some behaviors just cause more problems for some people. There are some questions you can ask yourself to determine if a behavior might be problematic: Does it hurt you? Do you feel as though you need to do the behavior? Does it hurt someone else? (physical, emotional, financial, etc.) You will be asked a simple series of Yes/No questions and presented with a profile comparing your responses with others who have taken the test. Our process ensures that no one but you will know your results. There is no information to link you with your assessment. We include further suggestions at the conclusion of your assessment. The Sexual Addiction Screening Test (SAST) is designed to assist in the assessment of sexually compulsive behavior which may indicate the presence of sex addiction. Developed in cooperation with hospitals, treatment programs, private therapists, and community groups, the SAST provides a profile of responses which help to discriminate between addictive and non-addictive behavior. Before starting the assessment we need basic information in order to build your profile. see recovery zone dot com /tests/lib/UCCASSv1.8.1/survey.php?sid=53",

I really miss all the fun we had in the bedroom. You were so hot and open minded. We had some kinky times..... the toys, the dress up, the chat lines, and the role playing, I miss hearing you talk about your fuck stories while you layed next to me in bed and watched me stroke for you. I really, really want to meet up again and have those kinky intimate times with you, again. If you feel the same, and want to explore with me, discretely, of course, then reply to this post with a familiar dogs name in the subject line so I know it's you. Hope this post finds you happy and healthy. Also, saw a picture of you recently, you are more beautiful then ever!!!",
